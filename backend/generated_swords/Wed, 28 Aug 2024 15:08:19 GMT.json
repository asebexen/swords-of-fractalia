Its latent voice, an echo of the dragon's dignity, whispers of courage in the face of adversity, subtly guiding its wielder to aspire toward the highest ideals of chivalry and valor. In battle, the sword's keen edge, ignited by the fiery essence of the Dragonstear, burns brighter as its bond to the spirit ignites a fierce determination, stirring the hearts of its allies and striking dread into the hearts of its foes.",

As it dances in the light, every swing whispers the following of noble heroes, binding the fates of those who would wield it in pursuit of justice. In its quest to embody the very essence of chivalry, this living sword aspires to unify the hearts of individuals under the banner of Neir, championing the eternal struggle for virtue amidst the chaotic tapestry of the world.",

Let honor be my blade, and chivalry my guide; may the worthy wield me, bringing light to the shadows, and justice to the unjust. In every swing, may courage rise, forging a path of virtue in a world fraught with darkness.\""
